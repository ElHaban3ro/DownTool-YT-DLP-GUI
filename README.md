# DownTool (YouTube Videos Downloader, NO ADS)



Welcome to DownTool, a tool to **download** youtube videos in bulk or individually. 

The **App** is developed with the **Tkinter** GUI library and uses **yt-dlp** to download the videos. The formats in which the videos are downloaded are **MP3** format for audio, and **MP4** for video. As for the quality of the videos and audios, the best of the **videos/audios** is always taken, this can be easily changed by accessing the **quality** of the videos and in the download modules, change the format. Somewhere in the download modules there is a **(commented)** printout for you to get the qualities, this is not really what I **need**.


This app was developed with the goal of being able to download YouTube videos in **mass** without having to deal with pages full of ads. Do you want to improve it? Go ahead :) Fork

## Â¿How Work?

It is quite easy. The program prompts you for an ***input***, where you will enter your **link**. 


You can do this either as a single link:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KkX7UVdTN8
```
---
Or several links separated by commas:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDZvMKfrzaM, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmp2gFwZXPs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Ui0XAkwmc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgnJdGXB3lE
```
---
If your ***case*** is to download even more massive videos, you can try passing the link of a public ***playlist***:

```
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuFY9Ixj9Z6nf7z6t5YmPDTLBgksk8Ts
```
---
Or, if you prefer to download your favorite playlists from Spotify, just leave us your link!
```

## Installation

Use pip to install requirements

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
To run the program in development mode, once the requirements have been installed, simply run the DownApp.py file

---

If you want to create a package for your operating system, use the command:

```bash
  pyinstaller --windowed --icon=./Resources/Icons/DownTool_2.ico DownApp.py
```

And then move the ***Resources*** folder to ***dist/DownApp/***.

We do this so that the resources like images or fonts work correctly. Once this is done you can use the executable.Next, you can remove the folder from the ***dist*** directory and delete these two: ***dist*** and ***build***.
