# DownTool (YouTube Videos Downloader, NO ADS)


Welcome to DownTool, a tool to **download** videos from youtube in mass or single. If you want to pass several videos to download, it is important to pass the links separated by commas.

The **App** is developed with the **Tkinter** graphical interface library and using **yt-dlp** to download the videos. The formats in which the videos are downloaded are in **MP3** format for audio, and **MP4** for video. As for the quality of the videos and audios, the best of the **videos/audios** is always taken, this can be easily changed by accessing the **quality** of the videos and in the download modules, change the format. Somewhere in the download modules there is a print **(commented)** for you to get the qualities, this thing about choosing the qualities because it really isn't what **I need**.


This app was developed with the aim of being able to download videos from YouTube en **masse** without having to deal with pages full of advertising. Do you want to improve it? Go ahead :) Fork
